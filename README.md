# Restaurant Landing Page 🍔

Welcome to my Restaurant Landing Page project! This is a modern, vibrant website designed to showcase a restaurant's atmosphere and menu. I built this to practice creating complex layouts—like split-screens and masonry grids—using nothing but clean HTML and CSS.

## 🛠 What's Under the Hood?

I kept things simple and fast by using core web technologies without heavy frameworks:

* **HTML5**: The skeleton of the page, written with clean and semantic tags.
* **CSS3**: The styling engine. I used modern tools like **Flexbox** for alignment and **CSS Grid** for the image gallery.
* **Google Fonts**: To give it that premium feel, I used a mix of *Raleway*, *Poppins*, and *Figtree*.

## ✨ Cool Features

* **It Fits Every Screen**: Whether you open this on a massive 4K monitor, a laptop, or your phone, the layout adapts perfectly.
* **Smart Image Grid**: The food gallery isn't just a boring list. I used CSS Grid to create a masonry-style layout where images resize and stack beautifully depending on your screen width.
* **No-JavaScript Menu**: The mobile "hamburger" menu works 100% with CSS. No JavaScript was needed to make the dropdown toggle open and close—just some clever checkbox logic!
* **Custom Styling**:
    * A smooth, slanted gradient background that runs across the whole page.
    * Transparent hover effects on the mobile menu for a sleek touch.
    * A "stacked" layout for tablets so images stay big and visible.

## 🚀 How to Run It
You don't need any special servers or compilers for this.

## 📂 Project Structure

Here is how the files are organized:

```/

🎨 Typography Choices
I picked fonts that balance readability with style:

Headings: Raleway (Bold and punchy)

Body Text: Poppins (Clean and easy to read)

Buttons: Figtree (Modern and rounded)

Navigation: Georgia Pro (Classic serif for a touch of elegance)```
